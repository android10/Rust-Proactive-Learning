## Rust Proactive Introduction

The code is a bit messy but it serves just as a personal Rust Playground to play around and understand the language. You can use to explore language feature and try things out. This `README.md` file will help you setup the IDE too. For managing the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), I use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).

## Run the project

 - `cargo run`

## Messy code structure

```rust
#[path="basic.rs"] mod basic;
#[path="intermediate.rs"] mod intermediate;
#[path="advanced.rs"] mod advanced;

fn main() {
    basic::basic_rust();
    intermediate::intermediate_rust();
    advanced::advanced_rust();
}
```

So the files to check and play around are:

 - `basic.rs`
 - `intermediate.rs`
 - `advanced.rs`

## Setup IDE (VSCode)

### Extensions

 - **rust-analyzer:** Supports code completion, go to definition, go to implementation and go to type definiton, syntax highlighting. You can find more about rust-analyzer at [the official website](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html).\
 - **crates:** To manage the dependencies with `Cargo.toml` file.
 - **CodeLLDB:** Supports native and remote debugging, disassembly, reverse debugging, core dump inspection. [Here more about codelldb](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb).
 - **Better TOML:** Syntax hightlighting and validation for `.toml` files and `markdown` files.
 - **Error Lens::** Tool that helps you highlight errors, warnings and show other kinds of language diagnostics as soon as you make a change in the code.
