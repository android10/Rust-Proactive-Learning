## Rust Proactive Learning: intro

The code of this particular `intro` project is a bit **messy** but it serves just as a personal playground to play around **Rust**.

## Learning Purpose

 - **Variables and Primitives**
 - **Tuples**
 - **Functions**

## Run the project

 - `cargo run`

## Code Structure

```rust
#[path="basic.rs"] mod basic;
#[path="intermediate.rs"] mod intermediate;
#[path="advanced.rs"] mod advanced;

fn main() {
    basic::basic_rust();
    intermediate::intermediate_rust();
    advanced::advanced_rust();
}
```

So the files to check and play around are:

 - `basic.rs`
 - `intermediate.rs`
 - `advanced.rs`
