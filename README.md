## Rust Proactive Learning

This git repository serves as a **Rust Playground** to learn and understand the language:
 
 - I wrote a **blog post**: [How to learn a new programming language: Rust]() which will serve as a guide for the purpose.
 - This `README.md` file will help you **setup the IDE and tooling** necessary to get started.
 - The `README.md` also contains **references, books and material** I used to dive deeper into Rust. 

## Repo Organization

Each part that I learned is split up into **different sub-projects** that will address different parts of the language. Feel free to **fork** or **clone** this project and do not hesitate to **contribute/collaborate**.

## Rust Installation

For managing [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installation and versions, I use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).

## IDE Setup for VSCode or [Code-OSS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Visual_Studio_Code) (Arch Linux Open Source Version)

### Extensions
